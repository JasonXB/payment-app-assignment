TO DO
Make sure the search / export buttons, search field, and dropdown menus all have the same height

Optimize with useMemo and useCallback
Fix highlights on drop down menus
Make the 3 rectangles up top actually have dynamic values (use React context)
Make all shadow-lg and shadow-md 's match (After you put the site together)
Add number of ending payouts (use dynamic value)
Add trailing dots to any text box that can be long depending on the value
Remove comments you don't need
